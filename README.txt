Instructions - 

To play just run the Driver file. To make guesses 
click on one of the buttons and try and match the
image that appears to its pair. The images are 
randomly arranged on the board each game. When 
a pair is found they will be remain uncovered for 
the remainder of the game or until the reset button 
is pressed and you will be given a point. If a pair 
is not uncovered you have 3 seconds to look at the 
images before they are recovered and no point is given.
Try and uncover all the pairs with as little tries as 
possible.
